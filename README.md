## Overview

### Project Insight

   All aboard! Welcome to the Sodor Train Station. Get ready to embark on a journey of a lifetime!
   
   This application utilizes Google's Firebase to synchronize user input in real-time. Simply add your train's information, such as departure time and train name, and let Firebase do the rest!

### Technologies Utilized

* **Backend**: Firebase
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap

## Instructions

1) In the form in the lower half of the page, the user enters the following: Name, Destination, First Train Time (the time at which the train first departs), and Frequency (how often the train departs/arrives) into the appropiate fields.
2) Once done, this information will be sent to the database, where it will then calculate when the train will arrive next, as well as how far the train is away.
3) After completion, pack your bags!
